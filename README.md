## About
This project already had lots of versions, this would be the latest.
<br />
Now with better performance, for example the images load up as you're scrolling down.
<br />
The colors in the background now are changing progressively.
<br />
I also made a video about it, that can be seen [right here](https://youtu.be/xmDRtEEtXWo).

## Prerequisites
To run in Windows 10 you need to install some tools, like: NodeJS, Chocolatey and more. [here](https://github.com/MestreALMO/React-Requires-To-Run-Windows-) is how to install all of it.
<br/>


## Running
Access the root of the project with a terminal, don't forget to run ```yarn``` if it is the first time running the project, then run the code:
```
yarn dev
```
With that the app will be running! 
<br />You can access it with ```http://localhost:3000/```
